# UAB CINL Documentation

## About

The Civitan International Neuroimaging Laboratory provides a core resource at UAB for state-of-the-art MRI neuroimaging experiments and analyses for examining brain and body anatomy and function both in health and disease.

This houses technical information for CINL pertaining to both scanner procedures as well as data storage, organization, pre-processing, and processing on UAB's computing cluster Cheaha. Cheaha provides researchers with both data storage space as well as a large amount of computational power necessary for high-throughput neuroimaging analysis. Access to the Cheaha cluster is free for UAB researchers. Request an account using the following [instructions](https://uabrc.github.io/account_management/uab_user/)
