# UAB CINL Documentation

## About

The UAB Civitan International Neuroimaging Laboratory (CINL) provides a core resource at UAB for state-of-the-art MRI experiments and analyses.

This site is meant to provide useful documentation for researchers, including CINL policies and procedures, equipment and facility information for grant applications, as well as information on data storage, organization, pre-processing, and processing methods on UAB's high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, Cheaha. Cheaha provides researchers with both data storage space as well as a large amount of computational power necessary for high-throughput neuroimaging analysis. Access to the Cheaha cluster is free for UAB researchers. Request an account using the following [instructions](https://uabrc.github.io/account_management/uab_researcher/).

> ## CINL Mission
> - To serve as a state-of-the-art research laboratory that fosters the advancement of functional magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy technique development for neurosciences, neuro-developmental and cognitive applications, CNS diagnostics, and glial biology research,
> - To provide clinical functional neuroimaging capabilities to a wide array of researchers in translational neurosciences, and
> - To assist with planning neuroimaging and spectroscopy data analyses and post-processing.
