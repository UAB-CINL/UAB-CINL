# Welcome to UAB CINL's documentation!

The Civitan International Neuroimaging Laboratory provides a core
resource at UAB for state-of-the-art MRI neuroimaging experiments and
analyses for examining brain and body anatomy and function both in
health and disease.

This houses technical information for CINL mainly pertaining to data
storage, organization, pre-processing, and processing on UAB's computing
cluster Cheaha. Cheaha provides researchers with both data storage space
as well as a large amount of computational power necessary for
high-throughput neuroimaging analysis. Access to the Cheaha cluster is
free for UAB researchers. Request an account using the following
