# Getting Started

This documentation will provide a brief overview of the steps required to get your MRI project up and running at the CINL Prisma scanner.

1. Review our [Policies and Procedures](/policies/).
2. Apply for [funding]().
3. Apply for a P-Number.
4. Complete training.
4. 

## Apply for P-Number

A P-number is how your specific project will be identified in the CINL system. All billing for scans will be applied to the account for the associated project for the P-number given during scan scheduling. In order to get a P-number, please fill out the MRI Only (Pre-Clinical/Basic Science) Inquiry Form **and** the “MRI Only (Pre-Clinical/Basic Science) Review/Quote Request” at the bottom of the [New CINL Study Forms](https://redcap.dom.uab.edu/surveys/?s=PJPANNA439) page.

Send both of these completed forms to cinl@uab.edu.

Please read the [onboarding](onboarding.md) documentation for more information.

## Training

If you and your study personnel have not already done so, you must complete CINL MRI Safety Training. Please schedule this with Elizabeth Ingram (ekingram@uabmc.edu). Please read over the [training protocols](training.md) for more information.

## Implants

Before a scan begins, any participant must be screened to be sure no unsafe risk factors are present for being in an MRI. For more information on risk factor and implant policies and procedures, please read the [implant documentation](implants.md).

## Key Card Access

To obtain key card access to the Prisma MRI scanner area, message Ingia Gentry at CINL@uab.edu. Please provide the string of numbers at the bottom of the back side of the UAB ID badge(the string usually starts with a "4*" and ends with a "-E”).

## Calendars

To gain access to the Google calendars used for scheduling, please send a request to Elizabeth Ingram (ekingram@uabmc.edu). You will need to provide Elizabeth your email address. It is easiest to use a gmail address (which will also integrate it into their already existing google calendar).

!!! warning

    This is a Google calendar, so no PHI should ever be entered!
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

See [scheduling](scheduling.md) documentation for more details on how to properly format a scan time request. Research groups may not use the scanner unless a request is submitted for a given timeslot.

## Email Listserv

It is required to be subscribed to the CINL listserv for scan rescheduling and cancellation announcements. To join the listserv, send an email to listserv@listserv.uab.edu with the email body as sub cinl-notice. Afterwards, you’ll receive an email to confirm your email address. After confirming your email address, you would start receiving cancellation emails from others on the list as well as be able to send your own notifications.

## Onboarding for New Studies

The first step in establishing a new study with CINL is to complete and submit our Inquiry and Quote Request forms. Both of these forms can be found either embedded or linked on the [Research MRI Core site](https://www.uab.edu/cores/ircp/rmric/contact/new-studies).

1. MRI Only (Pre-Clinical/Basic Science) Inquiry Form: This is a short form for basic information. This form is embedded at the site linked above.

2. “MRI Only (Pre-Clinical/Basic Science) Review/Quote Request”: This form will take more time to complete and submit. It includes a request for a PDF of the protocol, however an idea of the sequences and total scan length should suffice temporarily until a complete protocol is in place. Initially, a PI can review the form and submit it after the required fields are completed. Please email us at CINL@uab.edu after you submit the forms. Feel free to reach out to us with questions. After Quote Request submission, a staff member will contact you about training, study logistics, billing, etc.

!!! note

    A completed Quote Request Form is required to get a P-number, which is a how your study will be identified as well as confirm the current per hour scan rate. Please submit this form on RedCap and then notify CINL (cinl@uab.edu).

## Development Hours

Each study receives up to 5 hours of development time for protocol setup and testing purposes. Follow our Calendar instructions (linked) for requesting this time keeping in mind to indicate the P-number along with PI name(s) and “development” when scheduling development time on the scan calendar. Once your study begins, CINL will not cover the cost of continued development time. If you believe you will need more than 5 hours of development time, or if you will require continued development time over the course of your study, please consider applying for the [Radiology/CCTS Imaging Development Voucher Program](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/radiology/research/funding-opportunities/uab-radiology-imaging-development-voucher-request#:~:text=To%20encourage%20and%20enhance%20imaging,PET%2FCT%2C%20Small%20Animal%20Imaging).
