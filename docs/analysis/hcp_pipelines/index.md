# HCP Pipelines

The [Human Connectome Project](https://www.humanconnectome.org), as part of its goal for making MRI data acquisition and analysis more uniform across projects and sites, developed a series of preprocessing pipelines for MRI images. These pipelines take advantage of the advanced image quality of HCP sequences and are available for multiple modalities including structural, functional, diffusion, and more.

The HCP Pipelines are distributed as a collection shell scripts that are able to be run on Cheaha at UAB.
