This page provides links to written documentation, tutorials, and videos for relevent software in neuroimaging analysis. Most video links on the page will go to the [MRI analysis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfodFxaCrr0eNkoc2F1IOidg4qe_TuOT4) playlist on UAB Research Computing's Youtube channel.

## Andy's Brain Book

[Andy's Brain Book](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an ongoing teaching effort by [Dr. Andrew Jahn](https://www.andysbrainblog.com/about) and is the sort-of successor to Andy's Brain Blog. For researchers new to fMRI analysis, this is a very useful breakdown of how to perform an analysis and interpret data with a variety of common software.

He also has [video series](https://www.andysbrainblog.com/videos) going through different types of analyses himself.
