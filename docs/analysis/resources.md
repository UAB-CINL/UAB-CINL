This page provides links to written documentation, tutorials, and videos for relevent software in neuroimaging analysis.

## Andy's Brain Book

[Andy's Brain Book](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an ongoing teaching effort by [Dr. Andrew Jahn](https://www.andysbrainblog.com/about) and is the sort-of successor to Andy's Brain Blog. For researchers new to fMRI analysis, this is a very useful breakdown of how to perform an analysis and interpret data with a variety of common software.

He also has [video series](https://www.andysbrainblog.com/videos) going through different types of analyses himself.

## Learning Neuroscience

A variety of message boards and mailing lists exist when searching for answers in neuroscience or in general. There are also various conferences and courses you can take to learn more about neuroimaging analysis. A list of some of the more helpful ones can be seen below:

1. [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/): message board with a wide array of neuroscience topics.
2. [NITRC](https://www.nitrc.org/): focuses more on specific software and technical questions in neuroimaging
3. [Neurohackademy](https://neurohackademy.org/): A summer school in neuroimaging and data science at University of Washington. Also have recordings of courses from previous years covering a huge variety of topics in the computational space.
4. [Neuromatch](https://neuromatch.io/): online community of computational neuroscientists whose mission is to foster inclusive global interactions for learning, mentorship, networking, and professional development. There is an [academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/) that focuses on teaching students through small group projects and a [conference](https://conference.neuromatch.io/) that provides a virtual platform for sharing scientific ideas and research.

### OpenfMRI

[OpenfMRI](https://openfmri.org/) is a data warehouse containing a large number of publicly available datasets. These data are distributed using a Pulic Domain license, and so no registration or license agreement is necessary for accessing these data. Data scope and type vary highly across submitted studies. These data can be useful for both analyis for the purpose of publishing as well as teaching and learning.
