# Onboarding for New Studies

The first step in establishing a new study with CINL is to complete and submit our Inquiry and Quote Request forms. These are located on the [Research MRI CORE](https://www.uab.edu/cores/ircp/research-mri-core) website under “New Users” or you can simply click this link: [New CINL Study Forms](https://redcap.dom.uab.edu/surveys/?s=PJPANNA439).

1. “MRI Only (Pre-Clinical/Basic Science) Inquiry Form”: This is a short form for basic information.

2. “MRI Only (Pre-Clinical/Basic Science) Review/Quote Request”: This form will take more time to complete and submit. It includes a request for a PDF of the protocol, however an idea of the sequences and total scan length should suffice temporarily until a complete protocol is in place. Initially, a PI can review the form and submit it after the required fields are completed. Please email Eleanor at elewis1@uabmc.edu after you submit the forms. Feel free to reach out to us with questions.

!!! note

    A completed Quote Request Form is required to get a P-number, which is a how your study will be identified as well as confirm the current per hour scan rate. Please submit this form on RedCap and then notify CINL (cinl@uab.edu).

## Development Hours

Each study receives up to 5 hours of development time for protocol setup and testing purposes. Follow our Calendar instructions (linked) for requesting this time keeping in mind to indicate the P-number along with PI name(s) and “development” when scheduling development time on the scan calendar. Once your study begins, CINL will not cover the cost of continued development time. If you believe you will need more than 5 hours of development time, or if you will require continued development time over the course of your study, please consider applying for the Radiology/CCTS Development Time Voucher Program (linked).
