# Billing

For each study scan, we use the [linked RedCap form](https://survey.eyes.uab.edu/surveys/?s=KPP8TNFLEC) for tracking and billing purposes. Fill this out at the scanner console where we have a tablet dedicated to this form.

!!! note

    As of late 2021, the "Save and Return Later" function is failing to provide return codes. If this issue is resolved, we will let users know. The purpose of this function was so users could pre-fill some of the information, and then make note of the code to go back and continue to fill out the form at the scanner console.

There are paper copies at the scanner console in case the online form is not working. Once at the scanner, please make sure to mark the time that your set-up starts and when the start and end of your scan is.  You can also email yourself a copy of the form once it is completed.
