# MRI Safety Training

If you and your study personnel have not already done so, you must undergo at least CINL [Level 1 Safety Training](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/CINLPrismaSafetyTraining.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=xClmHX) in order to access the MRI facility. Please schedule this with Eleanor Yourich (elewis1@uabmc.edu) and Elizabeth Ingram (ekingram@uabmc.edu). To obtain key card access to the Prisma MRI scanner area, message Ingia Gentry at CINL@uab.edu. Please provide the string of numbers at the bottom of the back side of the UAB ID badge (the string usually starts with a "4*" and ends with a "-E‚Äù).

For certification to operate scanner, please reach out to Elizabeth Ingram (ekingram@uabmc.edu) and CC Eleanor Yourich (elewis1@uabmc.edu).
