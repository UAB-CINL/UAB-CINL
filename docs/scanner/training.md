# Training and MRI Access

## Training

In order to operate the scanner, two people who have been trained on MRI safety and at least one person who has been operationally trained must be present. Operationally trained individuals can include researchers who have undergone the relevant training or MRI technicians who can be requested to run the scanner during your session.

To be present during an MRI scan, you must read over the following documents regarding MRI safety and then schedule a time to undergo training with Eleanor Yourich (elewis1@uabmc.edu) and Elizabeth Ingram (ekingram@uabmc.edu) through email.

**Safety Training Documents**:

- [MRI Safety Presentation](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/L2%20MRI%20Safety%20Presentation.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=1mkBXW)
- [Safety Training Policies and Procedures](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/L2%20Safety%20Training.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=GcfDmX)
- [Safety Test](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/L2%20Safety%20Test.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=6vTyPl)

After safety training is complete, a researcher can be operationally certified by scheduling operational training and testing through Eleanor and Elizabeth.

## MRI Key Card Access

To obtain key card access to the Prisma MRI scanner area, message Ingia Gentry at CINL@uab.edu. Please provide the string of numbers at the bottom of the back side of the UAB ID badge (the string usually starts with a "4*" and ends with a "-E‚Äù).
