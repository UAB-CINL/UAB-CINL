# Training and MRI Access

## Training

All CINL users must complete MRI Safety Training.

In order to operate the scanner, two people who have been trained on MRI safety and at least one person who has been operationally trained must be present. Operationally trained individuals can include researchers who have undergone the relevant training or MRI technologists who can be requested to run the scanner during your session.

To be present during an MRI scan, you must read over the following documents regarding MRI safety and then schedule a time to undergo training with Elizabeth Ingram (ekingram@uabmc.edu) through email.

**Safety Training Documents**:

- [MRI Safety Presentation](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/L2%20MRI%20Safety%20Presentation.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=1mkBXW)
- [Safety Training Policies and Procedures](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/L2%20Safety%20Training.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=GcfDmX)
- [Safety Test](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/L2%20Safety%20Test.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=6vTyPl)

MRI Safety trained users may seek Operational Certification (O.C.) by first contacting CINL staff, then either working with CINL staff or an O.C. user to train prior to certification. Anyone seeking Operational Certification (O.C.) must email [CINL@uab.edu](mailto:cinl@uab.edu) prior to training. Failure to report scanner operations training to CINL Leadership is a safety concern and may lead to disciplinary actions including, but not limited to, voiding O.C. status for the research group involved. After OC training, please contact Elizabeth at [ekingram@uabmc.edu](mailto:ekingram@uabmc.edu) to schedule on-site certification.

## MRI Key Card Access

Facility access is granted to users who have completed MRI Safety Training. To obtain key card access to the Prisma MRI scanner area, message Ingia Gentry at [CINL@uab.edu](mailto:cinl@uab.edu). Please provide the string of numbers at the bottom of the back side of the UAB ID badge (the string usually starts with a "4*" and ends with a "-E‚Äù).
