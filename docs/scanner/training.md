# Training and MRI Access

## Training

In order to operate the scanner, two people who have been trained on MRI safety and at least one person who has been operationally trained must be present. Operationally trained individuals can include researchers who have undergone the relevant training or MRI technicians who can be requested to run the scanner during your session.

To be present during an MRI scan, you must read over the following documents regarding MRI safety and then schedule a time to undergo training with Eleanor Yourich (elewis1@uabmc.edu) and Elizabeth Ingram (ekingram@uabmc.edu) through email.

**Safety Training Documents**:

- [MRI Safety Presentation](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/L2%20MRI%20Safety%20Presentation.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=1mkBXW)
- [Safety Training Policies and Procedures](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/L2%20Safety%20Training.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=GcfDmX)
- [Safety Test](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/L2%20Safety%20Test.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=6vTyPl)

MRI Safety trained users may seek Operational Certification (O.C.) by first contacting Elizabeth and/or Eleanor, then either working with CINL staff or an O.C. user to train prior to certification. Anyone seeking Operational Certification (O.C.) must email either Elizabeth and/or Eleanor prior to training. Failure to report scanner operations training to CINL Leadership is a safety concern and will lead to disciplinary actions and may void O.C. status for the research group involved. After OC training, please contact Elizabeth ekingram@uabmc.edu to schedule on-site certification

## MRI Key Card Access

To obtain key card access to the Prisma MRI scanner area, message Ingia Gentry at CINL@uab.edu. Please provide the string of numbers at the bottom of the back side of the UAB ID badge (the string usually starts with a "4*" and ends with a "-E‚Äù).
