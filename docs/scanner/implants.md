# Implant Reporting and Policies

If a participant has an implant, please reach out to Elizabeth Ingram (ekingram@uabmc.edu) and upload documentation for the implant to Sharefile for her to review. Please read the [Implant Guide](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Implant%20Review/Sharefile%20Instructions.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=zo0AzU) and reach out to Elizabeth with any questions.

Keep in mind that certain implants may need more time or research any others. You can always ask general questions through email, however, you may be prompted to use ShareFile for in depth exchange of implant specifics and documentation.
