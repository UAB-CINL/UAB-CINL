# MRI Screening and Implants

## Participant Screening

Before beginning a scan, a participant must be taken through the [MRI Patient Screening Form](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Training/MRI%20Screening%20Form.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=tfbB4T). This screening form is mandatory each time a participant comes in for a scan regardless of whether they have filled out the form previously. Any risk factors discovered during the screening process will need to be reported and approved before scanning. For any questions about risk factors during screening, please contact Elizabeth Ingram at [ekingram@uabmc.edu](mailto:ekingram@uabmc.edu).

## Implant Policies

If a participant has an implant, please reach out to Elizabeth Ingram (ekingram@uabmc.edu) and upload documentation for the implant to Sharefile for her to review. Please read the [Implant Guide](https://uab365.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/som/circ/cinl/Shared%20Documents/Implant%20Review/Sharefile%20Instructions.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=zo0AzU) and reach out to Elizabeth with any questions.

Keep in mind that certain implants may need more time or require additional research than others. You can always ask general questions through email (no PHI!), however, you may be prompted to use ShareFile for in-depth exchange of implant specifics and documentation.
