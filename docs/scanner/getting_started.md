# Getting Started

This documentation will provide a brief overview of the steps required to get your MRI project up and running at the CINL Prisma scanner.

## Apply for P-Number

A P-number is how your specific project will be identified in the CINL system. All billing for scans will be applied to the account for the associated project for the P-number given during scan scheduling. In order to get a P-number, please fill out the MRI Only (Pre-Clinical/Basic Science) Inquiry Form **and** the “MRI Only (Pre-Clinical/Basic Science) Review/Quote Request” at the bottom of the [New CINL Study Forms](https://redcap.dom.uab.edu/surveys/?s=PJPANNA439) page.

Send both of these completed forms to cinl@uab.edu.

Please read the [onboarding](onboarding.md) documentation for more information/

## Training

If you and your study personnel have not already done so, you must undergo at least CINL Level 1 Safety Training. Please schedule this with Eleanor Lewis (elewis1@uabmc.edu).

## Key Card Access

To obtain key card access to the Prisma MRI scanner area, message Ingia Gentry at CINL@uab.edu. Please provide the string of numbers at the bottom of the back side of the UAB ID badge(the string usually starts with a "4*" and ends with a "-E”).

## Calendars

To gain access to the Google calendars used for scheduling, please send a request to Eleanor Lewis at elewis1@uabmc.edu. You will need to provide Eleanor your email address and it is easiest to use a gmail address (which will also integrate it into their already existing google calendar).

!!! warning

    This is a Google calendar, so no PHI should ever be entered!

See [scheduling](scheduling.md) documentation for more details on how to properly format a scan time request. Research groups may not use the scanner unless a request is submitted for a given timeslot.

## Email Listserv

It is required to be subscribed to the CINL listserv for scan rescheduling and cancellation announcements. To join the listserv, send an email to listserv@listserv.uab.edu with the email body as sub cinl-notice. Afterwards, you’ll receive an email to confirm your email address. After confirming your email address, you would start receiving cancellation emails from others on the list as well as be able to send your own notifications.
